      Expand partnerships with Walmart and CVS to push more volume and promotions.
      Reassess strategies for Target, which shows low contribution ($404K).
   
5. Focus on High-Margin Products
      Promote Coca-Cola, Dasani, and Smart Water, which combine strong sales with high margins.
      Consider phasing out or repositioning underperforming brands.
   
7. Regional & City-Level Expansion
      Invest in marketing in top regions (West, Southeast) and cities (New York, San Francisco).
      Explore why cities like Omaha and Minneapolis are underperforming – perhaps due to distribution gaps or low demand.
   
9. Seasonal Planning
      Capitalize on December sales peak with marketing campaigns and inventory boosts.
   
11. State-Level Strategy
      Use targeted campaigns to boost sales in underperforming states.
